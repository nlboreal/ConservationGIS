#Reading in Vector Data {#vector}

We will use the R package ```sf``` for handling vector data. You will have to download and install this package from the CRAN repository (review section [4.10](https://ahurford.github.io/quant-guide-all-courses/rintro.html#r-packages) of the MUN Biology R manual if need a reminder of how to do this).

```{r}
library(sf)
```

To plot the data (i.e., make a map) we will also need the package ```ggplot2```, so make sure to load and install that as well.

```{r}
install.packages("ggplot2", repos= getOption("repos"))
library(ggplot2)
```

```{r}
setwd("C:/Users/ywiersma/Documents/BIOL4651/GISModule/ConservationGIS/HARV")
```

Downlaod the folder "HARV" to your working directory. If you do not remember how to check, and set your working directory, review section [4.2](https://ahurford.github.io/quant-guide-all-courses/rintro.html#working-directory). This folder contains data from the Harvard Research Forest. The vector data include a point file that represents sampling points, a line file that is the boundary of the resarch forest, and two polygon files that show the boundary of the research forest and the soil regions. 

We read these files in in a similar way as you read in a file like a csv file, but instead of using ```read.csv``` we use ```st_read()```

Read in the boundary shapefile (recognizable by the .shp extension) for the Harvard forest

```HARV_boundary <- st_read("harv_boundary.shp")```

Read in the the soil region shapefile for the Harvard forest

```HARV_soils <- st_read("harv_soils.shp")```

To create a map we will use the ```ggplot()``` function, with the ```geom_sf``` function.

```{r}
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = HARV_boundary) + 
  geom_sf(data = HARV_soils)
```

GIS maps are all about "layers" of data. The order in which data are displayed in ```ggplot``` is important. In the above code, we "layered" the ```HARV_soils``` polygon *over* the ```HARV_boundary``` polygon. Check what happens when we layer them in the opposite order: 

```{r}
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = HARV_soils) + 
  geom_sf(data = HARV_boundary)
```

Now the boundary file is over top the soils one and because it is a filled polygon, we can't see the soils layer. One way we can deal with this, is by adjusting the transparancy of the boundary layer with the ```alpha``` function. This adjusts the transparency from fully transparent (```alpha = 0```), to fully opaque (```alpha = 1```). 

```{r}
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = HARV_soils) + 
  geom_sf(data = HARV_boundary, alpha = 0.1)
```

We can also sympbolize data based on the attributes. Before we do that, let's explore the HARV_soils layer. If you type ```HARV_soils``` AT THE ```>``` prompt, you will see the metadata. You will see that in additon to some descriptions of the geographic reference system (for more on that, see the PROJECTIONS chapter), you will see some attributes, including different kinds of soil classification and drainage types. If we want to display the soil polygons by their SIMMONS_SO field, we would use the ```aes``` (for aeshtetics) function.

```{r}
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = HARV_soils, mapping = aes(fill = SIMMONS_SO)) + 
  geom_sf(data = HARV_boundary, alpha = 0.1)
```

The default colour scheme has been applied. You can change this using different built in colour maps. Below is the code to use the viridis colour map.

```{r}
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = HARV_soils, mapping = aes(fill = SIMMONS_SO)) + 
  geom_sf(data = HARV_boundary, alpha = 0.1) +
  scale_file_viridis_d()
```
